## About this repository

The contents of this repository were created in conjunction as hands-on labs for Newline's [Better Data Visualization with Svelte](https://www.newline.co/courses/better-data-visualizations-with-svelte) course by Connor Rothschild. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and if you're curious at all about Svelte, data visualization, or D3 it's well worth a look.

A few small notes for now before I flesh out this readme further: overall the code follows the structure as shown during the course content. I have made some small tweaks to styling and behavior in a few places according to what I prefer. There are a few minor bugs / feature improvements to be made to transitions and, in the scrollytelling project, making the hover behavior and scroll trigger combination play nice.
